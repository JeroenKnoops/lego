Why can't it
be *simple*
@css/yellow.css

But you continue

- Finding services
- Requesting access to services
- Requesting access to repos
- Configure the services
- Start coding
- Create lots of custom scripts
- Setup deployments

After a while

You want to test the system

This takes a lot of effort...

And you 
realize 
you are *slow*

very slow

very very slow

very very very slow

I wanted to work
lean again
@css/green.css

I started working on
# Digital Trust
and
# Blockchain
@css/orange.css

You can't build trust on
# Closed software
@css/orange.css

This was a driver to push the 
# Open Source
initiative further

# What is Open Source?
@css/green.css

The open-source model 
is a *decentralized* 
*software development* 
*model* that encourages 
*open collaboration*.
@css/orange.css

A main principle of open-source 
software development is 
*peer production*, with products 
such as source code, blueprints, 
and documentation *freely* available 
to the *public*.

@img/images/github-homepage.png

@css/white.css

Started as a
Research Pilot
@css/brown.css

Open Source
Team
@css/brown.css

Approved by
MT / CTO
@css/brown.css

To become the best
# software company
in healthcare
@css/brown.css

How did we
manage that?

What needed to change?

## Culture change
@css/red.css

Developers grew up
# with open source
Their bosses mostly not
@css/red.css

A lot of developers finally 
# admitted they were 
already doing open source
@css/red.css

So we needed to address
# the bosses
@css/red.css

#### How to change your company?
## Get a team of committed people 
## to guide the open source project.
@css/brown.css

#### How to change your company?
## Setup simple guidelines. 
## Take them from other 
## open source projects.
@css/brown.css

#### How to change your company?
## Start with minimal variation 
## of licenses. MIT f.e.
@css/brown.css

#### How to change your company?
## Get contracts / business impact 
## analysis and privacy impact 
## analysis approved...  
### for all third party services.
@css/brown.css

#### How to change your company?
## Start with new projects. 
## From scratch.
@css/brown.css

#### How to change your company?
## Start with supporting tools.
@css/brown.css

#### How to change your company?
## Scope open source to a
## small part of the organization.
@css/brown.css

#### How to change your company?
## Follow community standards, 
## not your company standards 
@css/brown.css

#### How to change your company?
## Get higher management 
## involved in spreading the message.

Procedure to 
Open Source
@css/green.css

https://github.com/philips-software/philips-howto-open-source

@img/images/how-to-open-source-1.png

# Internal procedures:
https://gitlab.ta.philips.com/open-source/howto-open-source

@img/images/how-to-open-source-2.png

# Key Considerations
  - Not all contributions can be evaluated
  - Contributor has the main knowledge
  - The contributor is responsible
@css/green.css

*Nothing* is 
published that 
might *risk* 
competitive 
advantage
@css/green.css

# This could include
# (but is not limited to):
  - Philips-specific projects: things tightly 
    coupled to/dependent upon our systems
  - Domain knowledge
  - Customer data
  - Unique Selling Points (USPs)
  - Medical Claims
  - Trade secrets
  - Anything else that would risk our competitive 
    advantage or could harm the Philips Brand
@css/green.css

The contribution 
delivers *value*

# Misconceptions
@css/orange.css

###### Misconceptions
## Free maintenance
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Now anyone can publish 
## anything under our 
## companies name.
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Organization smells
### "Don’t open source yet, 
### maybe project x can still
### use it”. 
### Wait until no-one needs it.
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Organization smells
### "Don’t feed the competitors."
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Organization smells
### "Use your own email account, 
### because otherwise you 
### will get in trouble"
@css/green2.css

Doing *open source*
feels like the *startup*
@css/purple.css

Constraints
@css/purple.css

No or limited
*QMS*
@css/purple.css

Follow *community
standards*
@css/purple.css

Make proper
- *documentation*
- *release notes*
- *changelogs*
@css/purple.css

Feels 
# Quick
and
# Modern
@css/purple.css

But...
@css/red.css

Projects which do not fit
@css/red.css

InnerSource
@css/brown.css

A lot of the benefits of OSS
But in a large organisation
With existing toolsets

Everybody must have 
# read
and 
# fork
access to repositories.

Everybody must be able to
make *Pull Requests*.

Using the methods of OSS internally
will increase the re-use.
Make it easy for new people to start.
Will make things easier to adjust
and to maintain.

Prevent a 
*fork-and-forget* 
culture
@css/orange.css

or even worse

Prevent the 
*copy-paste*
culture
@css/orange.css

or even worse

The 
*Not Invented Here*
Syndrome
@css/orange.css

Don't focus on commodity.
Be differentiative.

Conclusion
@css/pink.css

What was the difference
between the startup
and a big company?
@css/pink.css

- Size
- Number of Tools
- Legacy
- Procedures
@css/pink.css

By embracing the
# Open Source
principles
@css/pink.css

Less *Procedures*
@css/pink.css

Procedures change with
*Best practices* of 
the community
@css/pink.css

Legacy will *die*
or gets *maintained* by the
community
@css/pink.css

Innersource is *NOT*
the path to Opensource
@css/pink.css

OpenSource is the 
path to Innersource
@css/pink.css

And Innersource is
the path to happy
Developers
@css/pink.css

Example
@css/pink.css

Two Innersource
Initiatives within Philips
@css/pink.css

One started from
*Closed Source*
principles
@css/list.css

### 24 repositories open
@css/list.css

### 24 repositories open
If you have a license,
granted access to the
region and have read
access.
@css/list.css

One started from
*Open Source*
principles
@css/list.css

>1000 repositories open
@css/list.css

### >1000 repositories open
If you are on the
Philips intranet
@css/list.css

## Final Thought
# Pieter Hintjens:
"My only professional regret was to spend years 
of my life making *closed projects* for clients 
who inevitably threw my work away sooner or later."
