# 
# What is Open Source?
@css/green.css

The open-source model 
is a *decentralized* 
*software development* 
*model* that encourages 
*open collaboration*.
@css/orange.css

A main principle of open-source 
software development is 
*peer production*, with products 
such as source code, blueprints, 
and documentation *freely* available 
to the *public*.

# Key Considerations
  - Not all contributions can be evaluated
  - Contributor has the main knowledge
  - The contributor is responsible
@css/green.css

*Nothing* is 
published that 
might *risk* 
competitive 
advantage
@css/green.css

# This could include
# (but is not limited to):
  - Philips-specific projects: things tightly 
    coupled to/dependent upon our systems
  - Domain knowledge
  - Customer data
  - Unique Selling Points (USPs)
  - Medical Claims
  - Trade secrets
  - Anything else that would risk our competitive 
    advantage or could harm the Philips Brand
@css/green.css

The contribution 
delivers *value*

# Misconceptions
@css/orange.css

###### Misconceptions
## Free maintenance
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Now anyone can publish 
## anything under our 
## companies name.
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Organization smells
### "Don’t open source yet, 
### maybe project x can still
### use it”. 
### Wait until no-one needs it.
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Organization smells
### "Don’t feed the competitors."
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Organization smells
### "Use your own email account, 
### because otherwise you 
### will get in trouble"
@css/green2.css

# Conclusion

Culture must

@css/red.css

## Final Thought
# Pieter Hintjes:
"My only professional regret was to spend years 
of my life making *closed projects* for clients 
who inevitably threw my work away sooner or later."
