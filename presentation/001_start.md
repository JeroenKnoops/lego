Why can't it be simple
## Like in
## open source projects..
@css/yellow.css

But you continue

- Finding services
- Requesting access to services
- Requesting access to repos
- Configure the services
- Start coding
- Create lots of custom scripts
- Setup deployments

After a while

You want to test the system

This takes a lot of effort...

And
# you realize you are
slow

very slow

very very slow

very very very slow

Break

I started working on
# Digital Trust
and
# Blockchain
@css/orange.css

You can't built trust on
# Closed software
@css/orange.css

This was a driver to push the 
# Open Source
initiative further

# What is Open Source?
@css/green.css

The open-source model 
is a *decentralized* 
*software development* 
*model* that encourages 
*open collaboration*.
@css/orange.css

A main principle of open-source 
software development is 
*peer production*, with products 
such as source code, blueprints, 
and documentation *freely* available 
to the *public*.

# Key Considerations
  - Not all contributions can be evaluated
  - Contributor has the main knowledge
  - The contributor is responsible
@css/green.css

*Nothing* is 
published that 
might *risk* 
competitive 
advantage
@css/green.css

# This could include
# (but is not limited to):
  - Philips-specific projects: things tightly 
    coupled to/dependent upon our systems
  - Domain knowledge
  - Customer data
  - Unique Selling Points (USPs)
  - Medical Claims
  - Trade secrets
  - Anything else that would risk our competitive 
    advantage or could harm the Philips Brand
@css/green.css

The contribution 
delivers *value*

###### Misconceptions
## Free maintenance
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Now anyone can publish 
## anything under our 
## companies name.
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Organization smells
### "Don’t open source yet, 
### maybe project x can still
### use it”. 
### Wait until no-one needs it.
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Organization smells
### "Don’t feed the competitors."
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Organization smells
### "Use your own email account, 
### because otherwise you 
### will get in trouble"

-================================================-

Projects which do not fit
InnerSource

A lot of the benefits of OS
But in a large organisation
With existing toolsets

Everybody must have *read*
and *fork* access to repositories.

Everybody must be able to
make *Pull Requests*.

Using the methods of OS internally
will increase the re-use.
Make it easy for new people to start.
Will make things easier to adjust
and to maintain.

Prevent a fork-and-forget culture

or even worse

Prevent the copy-past culture

or even worse

The Not Invented Here Syndrome.

Don't focus on commodity.
Focus on your differentiator aspects.

-================================================-

## Final Thought
# Pieter Hintjes:
"My only professional regret was to spend years 
of my life making *closed projects* for clients 
who inevitably threw my work away sooner or later."

-===================================================================-

What was the difference
between the startup
and a big company?

- Size
- Legacy
- Procedures

By embracing the
# Open Source
principles

Less Legacy
Less Procedures

Procedures change with
Best practices of the community

Legacy will die
or gets maintained by the
community
